# Driver Monitoring System Using Raspberry Pi 5

A real-time Driver Monitoring System (DMS) built using Raspberry Pi 5 designed to enhance road safety by detecting signs of driver drowsiness and distraction. This project uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to monitor driver alertness and provide alerts in case of unsafe driving behavior.

## üöó Overview

This system captures live video feed using a connected camera and analyzes the driver's facial features to detect:
- Eye closure and drowsiness
- Head pose (nodding or looking away)
- Yawning
- Distraction or inattention

If unsafe behavior is detected, the system raises real-time alerts to warn the driver.

# Driver Monitoring System Using Raspberry Pi 5

A real-time AI-powered Driver Monitoring System (DMS) built on Raspberry Pi 5 that uses a camera module and a YOLOv8 deep learning model to detect critical driver behaviors. The system monitors whether the driver is wearing a helmet, using a phone, yawning, or showing signs of fatigue through open/closed eye detection. Upon detecting unsafe behavior, it triggers real-time alerts using a buzzer and LED to ensure on-road safety.

## üöó Overview

This system uses a camera feed and an object detection model (YOLOv8) to monitor the driver's actions and detect:
- Absence of helmet
- Phone usage while driving
- Yawning (a sign of drowsiness)
- Open/closed eye state to detect fatigue

When an unsafe action is detected, the system immediately alerts the driver with sound and light signals.
